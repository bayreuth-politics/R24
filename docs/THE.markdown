## __Take Home Exam__

Below you can find the take home exam for this class. You will have four weeks time to work on it and, therefore, will have to submit your response by __17 February 12pm__ (noon) via email.

__You must create a single output file which includes your code, figures and substantive responses. In any case, you must submit all materials you used (data, code, output) in a way that your results are fully replicable.__ 

You are **strongly** encouraged - but not required - to use RMarkdown to this end as it will help you to produce such an integrated file. An example file and instructions can be found in this page's menu, you may also reach out with questions that purely deal with RMarkdown. It may seem a bit complicated in the beginning but getting oyur head around RMarkdown will pay off.

Lastly, make sure to always explain your work and the choices you make when working with the data - recall that data analysis goes beyond mere estimation of models. 

Do reach out at any point if you have any questions. Best of luck!
