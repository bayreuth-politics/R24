## Preparation

Please download and install **R** and **RStudio** - and make sure it works on your machine - *before* 31 October. You can simply follow these steps: 

• To download R, go to: https://cran.rstudio.com/. Select and install the appropriate version for your machine.

• R is technically a programming language. Rather than using its raw interface, many people like R-Studio as a way of managing work in R. This makes data analysis much easier, for which reason we will be learning to use RStudio. Like R, the basic version of R-Studio is free. You can download it here: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download.

We will take the time to get accustomed to RStudio during our seminar. For a start, note though that that are two ways to execute commands in RStudio: You can directly enter commands in the *console* (the bottom left part). These are then executed but not saved; or, you open an *RScript-file* (e.g. click on 'File' then 'New File' then 'R Script'). This opens a script (top left part on your screen in RStudio) that can be saved on your machine and accessed at a later point. Generally, I strongly recommend you use the latter option as you will be able to save your code.

• As a final step in preparation of our seminar, please take your time to work through the first script on this website. The goal is to have the code replicated in your own RScript on your computer. To this end, you may either copy the code from the website or type it yourself. While the former probably sounds more appealing, I strongly recommend the latter - it will help you learn the basics much faster. It will be time well spent.

Note that there also is a glossary that explains frequent and useful terms. You may want to have a look at this or simply use this as a first help whenever you encounter a new term/concept you're not sure about.
